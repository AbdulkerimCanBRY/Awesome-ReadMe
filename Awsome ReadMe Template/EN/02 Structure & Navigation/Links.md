## 1\. What is a Link and Why is it Important?

A link (or hyper link) is a piece of text or an image that, when clicked, takes you to another destination. In `README` files, links are used for the following purposes:

  - **Citations/References:** Linking to the website of a library, tool, or article being used.
  - **Navigation:** Allowing users to easily navigate between different sections of the document (like a Table of Contents).
  - **Related Files:** Directing users to other important files in the project (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.).
  - **Interaction:** Linking to demo sites, contact addresses, or social media profiles.

## 2\. External Links

External links direct you to a website outside of the current document.

### Basic Syntax

The structure `[Display Text](URL)` is used to create a link.

  - `[Display Text]`: This is the text the user will see and click on.
  - `(URL)`: This is the web address that will be visited when clicked.

```markdown
Our project uses the [Google](https://www.google.com) search engine.
For more information, you can visit the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).
```

### Result:

Our project uses the [Google](https://www.google.com) search engine.

### Adding a Title

If you want a small description box (tooltip) to appear when hovering over the link, you can add a title in quotes after the URL.

```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com "Goes to GitHub's homepage")
```

**Result:** [GitHub](https://github.com "Goes to GitHub's homepage") (Hover your mouse over it)

## 3\. Internal (Anchor) Links

Internal links (anchor links) direct the user to a different heading within the same document. They are vital for facilitating navigation in long documents, especially when creating a **Table of Contents**.

### Syntax

The structure `[Display Text](#link-version-of-the-target-heading)` is used. The `#` sign indicates that the link is within the same page.

GitHub automatically generates a link version from your headings. The rules are:

1.  All letters are converted to lowercase.
2.  Spaces are replaced with hyphens (`-`).
3.  Emojis and special characters (`?`, `!`, `.` etc.) are removed.

**Example:**
To link to the heading `## 5. Advanced Link Techniques`:

```markdown
[Go to advanced techniques](#5-advanced-link-techniques)
```

**Result:** [Go to advanced techniques](#5-advanced-link-techniques)

## 4\. Relative Links

Relative links are used to link to other files within your project (repository). This keeps your project self-contained and ensures the links work regardless of where your project is copied.

### Link to a File in the Same Directory

```markdown
Please read the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for contribution rules.
```

### Link to a File in a Different Directory

```markdown
Installation instructions are located in the [`docs/INSTALL.md`](./docs/INSTALL.md) file.
```

## 5\. Advanced Link Techniques

### Image Links

To make an image a clickable link, simply nest a standard image definition (`![Alt Text](image-url)`) inside a link definition.

```markdown
[![Google Logo](https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png)](https://google.com)
```

**Result:** (You can click on the image below)

[](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://google.com%5D\(https://google.com\))

### Email Links (Mailto Links)

`mailto:` is used to create a link that opens the user's default email application.

```markdown
For questions, [email us](mailto:example@mail.com).
```

**Result:** For questions, [email us](mailto:example@mail.com).

## 6\. Best Usage Practices

  - **Be Descriptive:** The link text should clearly indicate where the link goes. Avoid vague phrases like "Click here."
      - **Bad:** For details, click \<u\>here\</u\>.
      - **Good:** For details, read \<u\>our installation guide\</u\>.
  - **Short and Clear:** Keep links as short and understandable as possible.
  - **Check:** Before publishing your document, ensure all links are working correctly. Broken links create an unprofessional impression.
