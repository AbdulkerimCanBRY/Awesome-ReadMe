## 1\. Italics

Used for mild emphasis, indicating terms, book titles, or a thought. It gently sets the text apart from the main flow.

### Syntax

You can italicize text by placing it between a single asterisk (`*`) or a single underscore (`_`).

```markdown
*This text is italic.*
_This text is also italic._
```

### Usage Examples

  - When indicating a thought: *I wonder if we should add this feature?*
  - For book or film titles: My favorite book is *The Alchemist*.
  - For mild emphasis: Before performing this action, *please* ensure you have taken a backup.

## 2\. Bold Text

Used for strong emphasis, indicating important warnings, keywords, or critical information that needs attention.

### Syntax

You can make text bold by placing it between double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).

```markdown
**This text is bold.**
__This text is also bold.__
```

### Usage Examples

  - For warnings: **CAUTION:** This action is irreversible.
  - For keywords: The project requires **Node.js** version 18 or higher to run.
  - For important steps: Don't forget to press the **"Save"** button first.

## 3\. Bold and Italic Text

The strongest emphasis method available. Used for highly critical warnings or expressions that need an extreme level of attention within the text.

### Syntax

You can make text both bold and italic by placing it between triple asterisks (`***`) or triple underscores (`___`).

```markdown
***This text is both bold and italic.***
___This text is also both bold and italic.___
```

### Usage Examples

  - For the most critical warnings: Running this command ***will permanently delete the entire database\!***
  - For exaggerated emphasis: Developing this feature took us ***months***.

## 4\. Strikethrough Text

Used to indicate information that is no longer valid or current, completed tasks, or an alternative to an idea.

### Syntax

You can strike through text by placing it between two tilde signs (`~~`).

```markdown
~~This text is struck through.~~
```

### Usage Examples

  - Outdated information: Requirements: \~\~Python 2.7\~\~ Python 3.8 or higher.
  - Showing a discounted price: Price: \~\~100 TL\~\~ **75 TL**
  - Completed tasks: To-do: \~\~Write the installation guide\~\~

## 5\. Inline Code

Used to separate technical terms, file names, variable names, short code snippets, or commands from the rest of the text. This is one of the most important emphasis tools for technical documentation.

### Syntax

You can format text as inline code by placing it between single backticks (`` ` ``).

```markdown
`This text is inline code.`
```

### Usage Examples

  - File names: Configure your settings in the `.env` file.
  - Function names: The `getUserData()` function returns user data.
  - Commands: Type `npm run start` in the terminal to launch the project.
  - Variables: You should not leave the `API_KEY` variable empty.

## 6\. Highlighted Text

Used to visually stand out a section of text as if it were marked with a highlighter. Although this feature is not in standard Markdown, it is supported by many platforms like GitHub.

### Syntax

You can highlight text by placing it between double equal signs (`==`).

```markdown
==This text is highlighted.==
```

### Usage Examples

  - To emphasize a conclusion: The analysis found that ==performance increased by 30%==.
  - To indicate a section the reader should focus on: ==Read this section carefully before skipping it.==

## 7\. Underlined Text

Used to draw attention by underlining a section of the writing. It is not in standard Markdown but is supported by GitHub.

### Syntax

You can underline text by placing it between `<ins>` and `</ins>` tags.

```markdown
<ins>This text is underlined.</ins>
```

### Usage Examples

  - To draw attention to another section of the text: Linux users are advised to read the <ins>Linux Installation Guide</ins>.
  - To indicate a section the reader needs to pay attention to: This feature was added in version <ins>2.3</ins>.

## 8\. Blockquotes

Although not a direct emphasis, it presents a block of text as an indented, attention-grabbing note, tip, or quotation. Therefore, it is an effective emphasis tool.

### Syntax

You can create a blockquote by placing a greater-than sign (`>`) at the beginning of the line.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote. You can use this to highlight important notes or tips.
```

### Usage Examples

> **Tip:** For better performance, make sure to run your database queries outside of loops.
