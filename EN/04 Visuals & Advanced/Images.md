## 1\. Why Should We Use Visual Media?

A picture is worth a thousand words. Using visuals in your `README` file offers many benefits:

  - **Showcases Your Project:** Screenshots of your project's interface explain how it works much faster than text.
  - **Increases Comprehension:** Complex architectural diagrams or flowcharts are easier to grasp than textual explanations.
  - **Grabs Attention:** Visuals break up walls of text, making your document look less intimidating and more engaging.
  - **Creates a Professional Image:** Well-chosen and placed visuals demonstrate the quality of your project and the effort spent on it.

## 2\. Basic Image Insertion (Syntax)

The basic syntax for inserting an image in Markdown is very similar to a link, but it is preceded by an exclamation mark (`!`).

`![Alt Text](Image URL or File Path)`

  - `!`: Indicates that this expression is an image.
  - `![Alt Text]`: Stands for "Alternative Text." This text is displayed/read if the image cannot be loaded or if someone using a screen reader examines the document.
  - `(Image URL or File Path)`: The location of the image.

## 3\. Image Sources: Where to Upload?

There are two main ways to include your images in your `README`:

### Method 1: From Within the Project (Relative Path)

The most reliable method is to upload the image files directly to your project's repository. A folder such as `assets`, `images`, or `docs` is usually created for this purpose.

**Example Folder Structure:**

```
project/
├── README.md
└── assets/
    └── screenshot.png
```

To include the `screenshot.png` image in `README.md` with this structure:

```markdown
![Project Screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)
```

### Method 2: From an External URL (Absolute URL)

You can also include the image from another website or an image hosting service. All you need to do is use the exact URL of the image.

```markdown
![External Image](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200)
```

> **Warning:** This method can cause your image to disappear if the external site deletes the image or changes the URL. Therefore, uploading directly into the project is generally preferred.

## 4\. Advanced Techniques: Sizing and Alignment

Standard Markdown does not offer a way to control image size or alignment. However, you can use the basic HTML `<img>` tag for these operations.

### Sizing

You can set the image's width and/or height in pixels.

```html
<img src="./assets/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
```

### Alignment

You can use HTML's `<p>` or `<div>` tags to center the image.

```html
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" width="500">
</p>
```

## 5\. Adding Animated GIFs

Animated GIFs are great for showing how a feature of your project works with a short animation. Adding a GIF is exactly the same as adding a regular image.

```markdown
![Feature Demo](./assets/feature-demo.gif)
```

## 6\. Adding Video (YouTube Example)

Markdown does not allow you to directly embed and play videos (like the `<video>` tag). However, the most common and effective solution is to use a **thumbnail image** of the video and **link it** to the video itself.

The user clicks on the video's image and the video opens in a new tab (e.g., on YouTube).

### Example:

```markdown
[![Project Introduction Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID)
```

  - You only need to replace `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` with the ID of your own video (e.g., the part after `v=` in the URL).
  - The outer `[]()` structure turns it into a link.
  - The inner `![]()` structure makes the content of the link an image.

## 7\. Best Usage Practices

  - **Optimize File Size:** Keep the file sizes of images (KB instead of MB) you add to your `README` file small. Large images cause the page to load slowly.
  - **Use Alt Text:** Always add a descriptive "Alt Text" for accessibility.
  - **Ensure Visual Consistency:** Pay attention to ensure that the visuals you use (screenshots, diagrams, etc.) are stylistically consistent with each other.
  - **Don't Overdo It:** Visuals are powerful, but using too many can make your `README` file look cluttered. Use only the visuals that serve a purpose.
